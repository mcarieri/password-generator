# password-generator

No better feeling than getting this working! My initial trouble began with simply where to start given the skeleton code. I started with the simplest task- which was declaring my variables. With some help from my tutor, Muhammad, I noticed some issues with my initial declaration, mainly including an empty universal password variable which unintentionally would cause my generated password to deleted itself upon running. My tutor also walked me through .concat statements, which proved essential in my writePassword function. I found these particularly interesting, and plan to explore .concat statements more independently.     

The last issue I ran into involved the password not reseting whenever the generate button was clicked, which I found to be caused by the fact that I mislabeled my writePassword and generatePassword functions. This was a simple yet overlooked syntax error that was quickly fixed upon realization.
